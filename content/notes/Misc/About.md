This site is the homepage for the Creative Coding workshop held at [TUMO Paris](https://paris.tumo.fr) from Feb 27 to Mar 3 in 2023. The workshop was taught by [Souren Papazian](https://www.sourencho.com/) with help from *todo*.

The materials here were used as a guide for teaching during the workshop and as a reference for the students afterwards.

You can browse the outcome of the workshop on this page: [[notes/OurCreations/Our Creations]]!
