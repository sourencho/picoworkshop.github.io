‚≠êÔ∏è In this tutorial we will learn how to use `sin` to create movement!

## Hello Sin Circle

The function `sin` is very useful because if you feed it time `t()`  it will grow and shrink and grow and shrink forever.

The value fluctuates from -1 to 1 to -1 to 1.

If we want a bigger value we can multiply it to get a bigger range for example -10 to 10:

`10 * sin(t())`

So if we use `sin` for the size of a circle, the circle will grow and shrink. 

Note that half the time we won't see the cirlce when the size is negative.

```lua
function _draw()
  -- clear screen
  cls()

  -- get time value
  time = t()

  -- size from sin
  size = 10*sin(time)

  -- circfill( x, y, radius, color )
  circfill(64, 64, size, 12)
end
```

## Fast forward and Slow motion

The circle is moving too fast!!

We can slow and speed up time by dividing or multiplying it.

So let's change code to be `time = t() / 2`

```lua
function _draw()
  -- clear screen
  cls()

  -- get time value
  -- divide time by 2 to slow it down
  time = t() / 2

  -- size from sin
  size = 10*sin(time)

  -- circfill( x, y, radius, color )
  circfill(64, 64, size, 12)
end
```

## Shifting the range

What if we want our circle to start from a positive size, let's say go from 10 to 30?

If we add 1 to sin, instead of -1 to 1 we will get 0 to 2 because `-1 + 1 = 0` and `1 + 1 = 2` 

So let's change our code to be:

 `s = sin(time)+1`

If we divide this by 2 we will get a nice 0 to 1 range:

`s = (sin(time)+1)/2`

Now that we have 0 to 1 we can easily get the range 10 to 30.

Let's make the size go from 0 to 20 by multiplying `s` by 20:

 `size = s*20`.

And then add 10 to make it from from 10 to 30:

`size = 10 + s*20`

```lua
function _draw()
  -- clear screen
  cls()

  -- get time value
  -- divide time by 2 to slow it down
  time = t() / 2

  -- change sin range to 0-1
  s = (sin(time)+1)/2

  -- size from sin shifted to 10-30
  size = 10 + 20*s

  -- circfill( x, y, radius, color )
  circfill(64, 64, size, 12)
end
```

### Exercise üçì

Can you mofiy the code to make the circle change color over time. From red to pink?

## Movement with sin

Similar to how we change scale, we can change position using `sin` and get a looping animation.

For example if we shift the `sin` range to be from 20 to 100 and pass it as the x and y position of a circle, it will move diagnally in a loop:

```lua
function _draw()
  -- clear screen
  cls()

  -- get time value
  time = t() / 4

  -- change sin range to 0-1
  s = (sin(time)+1)/2

  -- set pos to sin range 20-100
  pos = 20 + s*80

  -- draw circle
  circfill(pos, pos, 8, 12)
end
```

## Spinning with sin and cos!

Something cool about `sin` and it's sibling `cos` is that they can create circular motion!

If you set the x position of a circle to `cos` and the y pos to `sin` you will see it spin in a circle
  
  `x = center + radius * cos(time)`
  `y = center + radius * sin(time)`

```lua
function _draw()
  -- clear screen
  cls()

  -- get time value
  -- divide time by 2 to slow it down
  time = t() / 4

  -- change sin range to 0-1
  s = (sin(time)+1)/2

  -- size and color sin
  size = 8
  c = 12
  
  -- rotate
  center = 64
  r = 40
  
  x = center + r*cos(time)
  y = center + r*sin(time)

  -- draw path just because it's nice
  circ(center,center,r,1)

  -- draw circle
  circfill(x, y, size, c)
  
end
```
