### Boot and Navigate

Open [pico-8-edu.com](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/) and start trying out commands:

1. Create a cart
   
   Run
   `SAVE FIRST.P8`
   
2. Show you all your carts

   Run `LS` 

3. Open your cart editor and write code
   
   Press  `[ESC]` and type in `PRINT("HELLO WORLD!")`

5. Run your cart
   
   Press `[CTRL]` + `[R]`

6. Install demos and load those carts
   
   Run `INSTALL_DEMOS` and then `LS` to see the new folder DEMOS
   
   Run `LS DEMOS/` to see what's in there.
   
   Pick one and load it as the current cart via `LOAD DEMOS/JELPI.P8`
   
   Try running it with `RUN`
   
   Check out the code and sprites by pressing `[ESC]`


All of this is in the [[notes/Misc/Cheatsheet]] so don't worry about memorizing it!
